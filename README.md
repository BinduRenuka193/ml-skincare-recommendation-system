# ml-skincare-recommendation-system
In the vast world of skincare products, finding the right product for your individual skin 
concerns can be difficult. This skincare recommendation engine solves this problem by 
using machine learning to provide personalized product suggestions. The core algorithm is 
cosine similarity within content-based filtering, which focuses on structured data such as 
product type, ingredient list, and price. By converting these attributes into numeric feature 
vectors, the system can calculate cosine similarity between products to determine their 
relevance to each other.   
The process begins with data preprocessing, where product types are encoded and 
ingredients are vectorized. These vectors are then combined into a single feature set for each 
product. The system uses cosine similarity to measure how similar these feature sets are, 
generating a similarity matrix that highlights the most similar products. For a given product, 
the system identifies and ranks other products based on their similarity scores. The highest
rated products are recommended to the user, ensuring that suggestions are relevant and 
personalized. Ultimately, the system improves user satisfaction by providing personalized 
skin care recommendations tailored to individual needs, improving skin care results and 
optimizing the product selection process. By continuously updating and improving data sets 
and algorithms, the system remains effective and up-to-date with the latest skincare trends 
and products.
